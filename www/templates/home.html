<h1>Astronomical Algorithms Implemented</h1>

<br>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<br>

<div id="intro" class="twocolumn">

This is my implementation of various astronomical algorithms, mostly
<a href="http://www.willbell.com/math/mc1.htm">Astronomical
Algorithms by Jean Meeus</a>, with parts found around the home and
across the internet.

This web page pulls together examples of the techniques I have learned
for how to combine C++, Python and JavaScript. It also puts the
AAI server in a docker container as a micro-service (a really fat
micro-service in need of a multi stage build soon)
with <a href="http://www.nginx.com">Nginx</a> running as a reverse proxy.

It is also created using those techniques.

<p>
My purpose is to provide a complete, non-trivial example that is
complex enough to challenge the approach but easy to verify, in this
case by looking out a window.

The goal is to provide a good reference and demonstrate a
robust product with good error handling across the platform.

For example, the exception thrown by June 31
originates in my
<a href="https://github.com/lrmcfarland/Coordinates">
C++ coordinates library</a>, is caught on the server in the Python
wrapper, sent as a HTTP response to the client and displayed as a
JavaScript alert.
<p>
I developed this on OS X.

My public server is on Linux in AWS.

The code is built “by hand” with Emacs from open source projects and
is, of course, itself open source and available on GitHub
<a href="https://github.com/lrmcfarland/Astronomy">
here</a>.

I use test driven development to find and remove errors.

The mistakes that are left in here are all mine.

If you find them, please feel free to let me know.
