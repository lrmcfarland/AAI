<h2>Introduction</h2>

<br>

<div id="intro" class="twocolumn">

This is my implementation of various astronomical algorithms, mostly
<a href="http://www.willbell.com/math/mc1.htm">Astronomical
Algorithms by Jean Meeus</a>, with parts found around the home and
across the internet.

It pulls together examples of design patterns I have
learned for how to combine C++, Python and JavaScript.

Access to the implementation here is through a flask server in a docker
container as a micro-service (a really fat micro-service in need of a
multi stage build soon).

The server provides
an <a href="https://github.com/lrmcfarland/AAI/blob/master/www/api.py">AAI
API</a> to support various operations like transforming an
observer's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_coordinate_system">horizontal
coordinate system</a>
to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equatorial_coordinate_system">an
  equatorial</a> one.

This is used to support this web page as well as data operations
for the <a href="https://db.starbug.com/">starbug database</a>
like standardizing input data.

<p>
My purpose is to provide a complete, non-trivial example that is
complex enough to challenge the approach but easy to verify, in this
case by looking out a window.

The goal is to provide a good reference and demonstrate a
robust product with good error handling across the platform.

For example, the exception thrown by June 31
originates in my
<a href="https://github.com/lrmcfarland/Coordinates">
C++ coordinates library</a>, is caught on the server in the Python
wrapper, sent as a HTTP response to the client and displayed as a
JavaScript alert.
<p>

The code is built mostly "by hand" with Emacs from open source
projects and is, of course, itself open source and available on GitHub
<a href="https://github.com/lrmcfarland/Astronomy">
here</a>.

I use test driven development to find and remove errors.

The mistakes that are left in here are all mine.

If you find them, please feel free to let me know.
