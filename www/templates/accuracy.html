<h2>On Accuracy</h2>

<br>

<div id="accuracy" class="twocolumn">

I have been working on several ways to test the accuracy of the model.
Beyond noting the sun rise and set times along with local noon on an
improvised sun dial (the sunbeam from the skylight on my south facing
stairs), I have used a
<a href="https://www.starpath.com/catalog/accessories/1840d15.htm">Davis
Mark-15 Plastic Sextant</a>
with a swimming pool as an artificial horizon.
While I have no training other than what came in the instructions with
the sextant, on a clam day with a stable reflection I get results
within a couple arc minutes of my calculations.
I use these results in the
<a href="https://github.com/lrmcfarland/Astronomy/blob/master/Bodies/test_SunPosition.py">source
code unit tests</a>.

<p>
I also have agreement within a couple minutes of other sites like the
<a href="http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/grad/solcalc/">NOAA solar calculator</a>
and the
<a href="http://aa.usno.navy.mil/index.php">Astronomical Applications
Department of the U.S. Naval Observatory</a>

And in references like Wikipedia's
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnight_sun">midnight sun
reference</a>, I get the results they have for the rise, transit and
set times for Fairbanks, Alaska, when making the adjustments for time
zone they list.

<p>
The picture below was taken (on 2016-05-08) with the iOS
<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/theodolite/id339393884?mt=8">
Theodolite</a> app (I have no connection to them other than as a
satisfied customer.)  When I enter the time and location coordinates,
I get good agreement in altitude (my 22.87&deg; vs. their 22.3&deg;)
and am only off by about 10&deg; azimuth (274.73&deg; vs. 265&deg;),
and some of that I would attribute to some "stickiness" in the
sensors.
