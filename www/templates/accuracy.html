<h2>On Accuracy</h2>

<br>

<div id="accuracy" class="twocolumn">

  I have been working on several ways to test the accuracy of the model.
  Beyond noting the sun rise and set times along with local noon on an
  improvised sun dial (the sunbeam from the skylight on my south facing
  stairs), I have used a
  <a href="https://www.starpath.com/catalog/accessories/1840d15.htm">Davis
    Mark-15 Plastic Sextant</a>
  with a swimming pool as an artificial horizon.
  While I have no training other than what came in the instructions with
  the sextant, on a clam day with a stable reflection I get results
  within a couple arc minutes of my calculations.
  I use these results in the
  <a href="https://github.com/lrmcfarland/Astronomy/blob/master/Bodies/test_SunPosition.py">source
    code unit tests</a>.

  <p>
    I also have agreement within a couple minutes of other sites like the
    <a href="http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/grad/solcalc/">NOAA solar calculator</a>
    and the
    <a href="http://aa.usno.navy.mil/index.php">Astronomical Applications
      Department of the U.S. Naval Observatory</a>

    And in references like Wikipedia's
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnight_sun">midnight sun
      reference</a>, I get the results they have for the rise, transit and
    set times for Fairbanks, Alaska, when making the adjustments for time
    zone they list.

  <p>
    The picture below was taken (on 2016-05-08) with the iOS
    <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/theodolite/id339393884?mt=8">
      Theodolite</a> app (I have no connection to them other than as a
    satisfied customer.)  When I enter the time and location coordinates,
    I get good agreement in altitude (my 22.87&deg; vs. their 22.3&deg;)
    and am only off by about 10&deg; azimuth (274.73&deg; vs. 265&deg;),
    and some of that I would attribute to some "stickiness" in the
    sensors.


  <p>

    From Meeus' Example 13.b, the observer's location is at the
    U.S. Naval Observatory at Washington, D.C.: Latitude 38:55:17,
    Longitude -77:03:56 (in my ":" notation for degrees, minutes,
    seconds and using the IAU positive east convention for latitude
    instead of Meeus'); Venus' right ascension is 23:09:16.641 hours and
    declination -6:43:11.61 degrees.  On 1987-04-10 at 19:21:00 UT,
    Venus was 15.215 degrees above the horizon, bearing 248.0335 from
    the north, which matches Meeus' results after adjusting his bearing
    of 68.0337 degrees from the south.
